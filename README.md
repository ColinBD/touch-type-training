# Introduction

Touch Type Trainer is a work-in-progress app to help users improve their typing skills.

The user journey will look as follows: 
1. A user sees some basic touch typing instructions
2. They select a text topic and the quantity typing they want to do
3. A quotation is then displayed on screen which the user should type, with visual feedback showing them where they are within the text.
4. Further quotes are presented, with the number determined by the quantity of typing the user selected  
5. Once all quotes have been typed, the user is presented with their results, showing them their error rate for each character
6. The user is then invited to undertake training, which consists of more text to type, but this text is auto-generated based on the users error profile.

# Project status
The project is in a early stage. Thus far, the first three stages listed above have been implemented. Imediate next stages in the build are as follows:
1. Retreive quotes from open APIs (to replace the hard-coded quotes presently used).
2. Implement quote iteration, so the completion of one quote leads to either the presentation of the next quotation or, after the last quote, the presentation of the results page.

Then...
3. Check the status or error logging (we should be capturing the number of correct key presses and incorrect key presses for each key over the set of quotes).
4. Present the results on the results page in a digestable way (e.g. bar graph or error rate from highests error rate on left to lowest on right)
5. Think about how to implement a training exercise.  

# Bootstrapped with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
