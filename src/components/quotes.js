If you're sitting around trying to dream up a great idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that's almost never the case.", "Design works best when it gets out of the user's way.", "If there is one word I'd like to remove from any conversation about design, it's “pretty.” ", "People don't use a product because of the great design; great design helps them use the product.", "Design is about enabling ideas, processes and products: making them approachable, usable, desireable and memorable.", "If a design can be refined, without disturbing its image, it seems reasonable to do so. A logo, after all, is an instrument of pride and should be shown at its best.","To push the boundaries, you need to know where the edges are.", "Good Design: 1. Fulfills its function. 2. Respects its materials. 3. Is suited to method of production. 4. Combines these in imaginative expression.", "Passion, dedication, and silly lists of what designers need are what designers need.", "Design is more of a kitchen than a knife, and more of a lab than a beaker.", "Thirty spokes meet in the hub, but the empty space between them is the essence of the wheel. Pots are formed from clay, but the empty space within it is the essence of the pot.

I want something beautifully plain.", "A good design is driven by needs and defined by constraints.", "I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say any other way - things I had no words for.", "Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.", "Every great design begins with an even better story.", "We make the whole widget.", "Testing one user early in the project is better than testing fifty near the end.", "Typography is a beautiful group of letters, not a group of beautiful letters.", "The difference between a weed and a flower is a judgement.", "Design must be functional and functionality must be translated into visual aesthetics, without any reliance on gimmicks that have to be explained.", "Web design is responsive design.

I'm not particularly interested in what's popular; I'm much more interested in what's good.", "Ability proceeds from a fusion of skills, knowledge, understanding and imagination, consolidated by experience.", "Never half-ass two things. Whole-ass one thing.", "It's extremely difficult to be simultaneously concerned with the end-user experience of whatever it is that you're building and the architecture of the program that delivers that experience.", "All the magic, be it in code or design, starts with a clear mind, pen and a blank paper.", "Design is to invent with intent. If you take away the 'invent' bit, you have an engineer. If you take away the 'intent' bit, you have an artist.", "The real issue is not talent as an independent element, but talent in relationship to will, desire, and persistence. Talent without these things vanishes and even modest talent with those characteristics grows.", "They enjoy giving form to ideas. If designers were made of ideas, they'd be their own clients.", "If a feature or product were legitimately easy the user would not be writing in to support about how stuck they are. Sure, some percentage of users will find questions to ask about any interface. But do you want to start the conversation by assuming the user falls into that percentage? You venture to learn much more if you assume the software is wrong, not the user.", "Best thing about creating something is that it starts living it's own life.", "The difference between an artist and a graphic designer. One says “it's finished when I feel it's finished” the other says “I will have this by the 30th.” ", "Even large companies need small logos.", "If people are made safer, more comfortable, more eager to purchase, more efficient, or just happier, the designer has succeeded.", "There is nothing glamorous in what I do.

Perhaps I'm luckier than most in that I receive considerable satisfaction from doing useful work which I, and sometimes others, think is good.", "Experience has shown that our best customers are ones who have as much respect for our time as we have for theirs.", "Some people say design is about solving problems. Obviously designers solve problems but so do dentists. Design is about cultural invention.", "I find that when someone's taking time to do something right in the present, they're a perfectionist with no ability to prioritize, whereas when someone took time to do something right in the past, they're a master artisan of great foresight.", "You get up early in the morning and you work all day. That's the only secret.", "It doesn't matter one damn bit whether fashion is art or not. You don't question whether an incredible chef is an artist or not - his cakes are delicious and that's all that matters.", "Of course design is about problem solving, but I cannot resist adding something personal.", "Use two typeface families maximum. OK, maybe three.", "Make it simple. Make it memorable. Make it inviting to look at. Make it fun to read.", "I am.", "Users will tell you what they think they want. Users will tell you what they think you want to hear. Users will tell you what they think sounds good. Users will not tell you what you need to know.

You think there's something tragically wrong with it - maybe there are bedbugs. But if you see a sofa on there for $2,500, you think 'oh man, that sofa must be amazing'. It's the same thing with art - you set your own value.", "Orient your UI around the job to be done - around the problem - and not the person.

JUST SIT THERE. DO NOTHING. IF WANT DO SOMETHING, NEED FIRE.", "I for one absolutely and unequivocally refuse to be bullied about by a thing's capacity to absorb light.

And design is the vehicle by which this expression is made possible. Art is a noun, and design is a noun and also a verb. Art is a product and design is a process. Design is the foundation of all the arts.", "Here is one of the few effective keys to the design problem - the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible - his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints. Constraints of price, of size, of strength, of balance, of surface, of time and so forth.", "What problem have you solved, ever, that was worth solving where you knew all the given information in advance? No problem worth solving is like that. In the real world; you have a surplus of information and you have to filter it or; you don't have sufficient information and you have to go find some.", "I recently saw another demonstration of graphic design's ubiquity. Someone had taken a series of photographs of busy streets and then painstakingly removed all the logos, symbols, signs, colours, street names and road markings. In other words, they had removed all the graphic design from these photographs. The results were staggering. A world without graphic design is an unrecognizable world - more alien than all but the most extreme sci-fi imaginings.", "Designers are crazy and yet sane enough to know where to draw the line.", "... another misinterpretation that's always bugged me: Ship early, ship often OR Ship quality product. Quality isn't something to be sacrificed. Ship early, ship often, sacrificing features, never quality.", "When you're a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you're not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You'll know it's there, so you're going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.", "The prerequisite of originality is the art of forgetting, at the proper moment, what we know.", "The sudden hunch, the creative leap of mind that “sees” in a flash how to solve a problem in a simple way, is something quite different from general intelligence.", "It is not so hard to be original, what is hard, is to be original with continuity.", "Interesting things never happen to me. I happen to them.", "I have thought about the nature of this creative process and have reached a somewhat aberrant conclusion. I don't understand it and I don't think anyone else does either.", "To create a memorable design you need to start with a thought that's worth remembering.", "Good design begins with honesty, asks tough questions, comes from collaboration and from trusting your intuition.", "The best ideas come as jokes.

You can continue to refine a work until it doesn't set off your own quality alarms, but that's no guarantee that what you've made will touch anybody.", "Unsolicited redesigns are terrific and fun and useful, and I hope designers never stop doing them. But as they do so, I also hope they remember it helps no one - least of all the author of the redesign - to assume the worst about the original source and the people who work hard to maintain and improve it, even though those efforts may seem imperfect from the outside.", "I love making the stuff, that's sort of the core of it. I love creating the stuff. It's so satisfying to get from the beginning to the end, from a shaky nothing idea to something that's well formed and the audience really likes. It's like a drug: You keep trying to do it again and again and again. I've learned from experience that if you work harder at it, and apply more energy and time to it, and more consistency, you get a better result. It comes from the work.", "Excellence is not a skill, it is an attitude.", "I met with a potential client today and part of their opening gambit was how they were looking for revolutionary work delivered within a tight timescale, and if the work could be done a reduced rate then they'd be able to send a load more work our way. ... They were saying that they wanted work that was fast, good, and cheap. And if the work was fast, good, and cheap enough, the reward would be the offer of more work that is fast, good, and cheap. ... Let me be clear about this, these people are evil, and their work is poison.", "The modern artist is working with space and time, and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating.", "The easier you make it for people to go, the more likely they are to stay.", "Perfection is boring. Getting better is where all the fun is.", "Simplicity and complexity need each other.", "Good design is a lot like clear thinking made visual.", "There is no excellent beauty that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.", "Be a part of the innovation that leads the wave. Don't wait for technology to catch up to you or you'll end up sliding down the back side of that wave.

The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.Maybe they have to be crazy.How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that's never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels? While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.", "The sharpness of the sword is not in the edge of the blade, but in the hand of the warrior.", "I believe that a good user interface is carefully targeted towards its audience, with the right mixture of simplicity, elegance and innovation.", "I would say my biggest pet peeve related to the industry would be people focusing on technology instead of design, standards instead of users, and validation rather than innovation. Web standards and best practices are noble goals, but all too often in our community people forget they are a means to an end, not the end itself.", "I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.", "We are all designers, the difference is that only a few of us do it full-time.", "Your opinion won't matter. It's important that you prove your point with numbers.", "The ultimate inspiration is the deadline.", "If you can't draw as well as someone, or use the software as well, or if you do not have as much money to buy supplies, or if you do not have access to the tools they have, beat them by being more thoughtful. Thoughtfulness is free and burns on time and empathy.", "When we have clients who are thinking about Flash splash pages, we tell them to go to their local supermarket and bring a mime with them. Have the mime stand in front of the supermarket, and, as each customer tries to enter, do a little show that lasts two minutes, welcoming them to the supermarket and trying to explain the bread is on aisle six and milk is on sale today. Then stand back and count how many people watch the mime, how many people get past the mime as quickly as possible, and how many people punch the mime out. That should give you a good idea as to how well their splash page will be received.", "A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless. By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there's something very bad going on.", "Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.", "There is no such thing as information overload, just bad design. If something is cluttered and/or confusing, fix your design.", "Designers deal in ideas. They give shape to ideas that shape our world, enrich everyday experiences, and improve our lives. Where there's confusion, designers fashion clarity; where there's chaos, designers construct order; where there's entropy, designers promote vitality; where there's indifference, designers swell passion; where there's mediocrity, designers imbue excellence; and where there's silence, designers lend voice.", "Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.", "This is our job as designers - to continue making decisions until the purpose of the design is perfectly clear. Then you are done.", "The major difference between a thing that might go wrong and a thing that cannot possibly go wrong is that when a thing that cannot possibly go wrong goes wrong it usually turns out to be impossible to get at or repair.", "All of the buildings, all of those cars were once just a dream in somebody's head.", "Fashion is a form of ugliness so intolerable that we have to alter it every six months.", "Teaching peers is one of the best ways to develop mastery.", "Sometimes you can draw more inspiration from the people who don't believe in you, then from the ones who do.", "At the age of six I wanted to be a cook. At seven I wanted to be Napoleon. And my ambition has been growing steadily ever since.", "Bad design shouts at you. Good design is the silent seller.", "If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization.

No, it just means I didn't want to stick to convention. If anything you can call it rebellious but certainly not creative.", "Influence is borrowed, inspiration is earned. Create opportunities to earn it, and have a plan to capture it.", "Clients are the difference between design and art.", "The simplest way to achieve simplicity is through thoughtful reduction.", "Do we really need a simple definition of design or should we accept that design is too complex a matter to be summarized in less than a book?
