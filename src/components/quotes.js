It's incredibly, ridiculously difficult. That's why, before the 14th century, everyone thought that multiplication was an incredibly difficult concept, and only for the mathematical elite. Then Arabic numerals came along, with their nice place values, and we discovered that even seven-year-olds can handle multiplication just fine. There was nothing difficult about the concept of multiplication—the problem was that numbers, at the time, had a bad user interface.", "Whoever heard of a musician who was passionately fond of B flat?

The drive to innovate can overencumber and destroy a product.", "The designer is not always right. The researcher is not always wrong. Profit is not always the motive; market research, whatever its outcome, should never be used as a good excuse for bad design – in the same sense that good design should never be used to promote a bad product.", "Write drunk; edit sober.", "I can always find love, but eventually I get horny for my creativity.", "The control which designers know in the print medium, and often desire in the web medium, is simply a function of the limitation of the printed page.

They're whores. If the one you're with isn't doing the job, there's always, always, always another.", "Design is a response to a specific problem. You are given a problem to solve, and then you let the problem itself tell you what your solution is.", "Modernism does not mean minimalism, contemporary does not forsake tradition, and technology does not mean abandon people and senses.", "Design is more than just a few tricks to the eye. It's a few tricks to the brain.", "The majority of iteration should be done in the privacy of your own head.", "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity.", "The ability to change on a dime is one thing small teams have by default that big teams can never have. This is where the big guys envy the little guys. What might take a big team in a huge organization weeks to change may only take a day in a small, lean organization. That advantage is priceless.", "Losing 80% of your screen space forces you to focus. You need to make sure that what stays on the screen is the most important set of features for your customers and your business. There simply isn't room for any interface debris or content of questionable value. You need to know what matters most.", "One can steal ideas, but no one can steal execution or passion.", "If it were easy to nut out tricky design problems, I might be out of a job. But it's also true that the cleverness in most lateral design doesn't come from blindly grinding away at the same concept. When you're dealing with ideas, it's rarely a matter of simply putting in more time working. Five minutes can be much more fruitful than five hours.", "There is only one type of designer — the type that cares about type.", "The best an idea gets is when it's in your head.", "Hackers don't need idea people when they are the idea people.", "Redesigning somebody else's product is always a tricky business.

Copying ten is research.", "A lot of companies have tried to support designers by giving them “a seat at the table.” What this usually means in practice, however, is that a designer is sitting at the table well after the important product decisions that influence the design have been made. This is usually where complicated and muddy designs are born.", "Instead of searching for inspiration, how about you search out someone to inspire.", "A friend once insisted to me that the plural of “moron” is “focus group.” ", "At this point in experience design's evolution, satisfaction ought to be the norm, and delight out to be the goal.", "I say that flat is the new black; that 2D is the new avant-garde; that a surface doesn't have to be ashamed of being a surface. Technology users of the world, unite: you have nothing to lose but your bas-relief buttons. Let us march forwards together, spurning chrome, into a cleaner, lighter future.", "Web design is art wrapped in technology.", "a 5% feature (used by less than 5% of all users) is a distraction for all the other users, and is better removed, unless it's really critical (a small number of users do need to cancel service, for example).", "A great logo isn't going to make a shitty product any less shitty, any more than a hard worker is going to make a bad boss a compelling leader.", "Wondering is the seed of genius.", "A designer, like an archaeologist or geologist; researches, uncovers and adds context to precious, overlooked treasures by digging deep beneath the surface.", "He who cannot draw on three thousand years is living from hand to mouth.", "There are too many elements on most web pages to affix or align each one to the baseline grid. Doing so would require a mathematical rigor that, if it can be achieved, might produce rationally exact measurements and placements but will most likely be something less than elegant. The result would be a design driven by math, rather than a design that uses math to create an elegant product.", "… people in the newspaper industry saw the web as a newspaper. People in TV saw the web as TV, and people in book publishing saw it as a weird kind of potential book. But the web is not just some kind of magic all-absorbing meta-medium. It's its own thing.", "Don't ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive and go do it.", "You don't get harmony if everyone sings the same note.", "Let the design team be the design experts. Your job is to be the business expert. Ask them how their design solutions meet your business goals. If you trust your design team, and they can explain how their recommendations map to those goals, you're fine.

But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not that good. It's trying to be good, it has potential, but it's not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn't have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know it's normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work … It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions … It's gonna take awhile … You've just gotta fight your way through.", "Well established hierarchies are not easily uprooted ", "Well you're in your little room and you're working on something good but if it's really good you're gonna need a bigger room and when you're in the bigger room you might not know what to do you might have to think of how you got started sitting in your little room (from the song “Little Room”) ", "I don't care if you're a billionaire.

You have to constantly craft and nurture a brand. You can't just let it be or it'll fritter away to mediocrity.", "Designing something is like having a baby.
