Make your thinking as funny as possible.", "The advice I like to give young artists, or really anybody who'll listen to me, is not to wait around for inspiration. Inspiration is for amateurs; the rest of us just show up and get to work. If you wait around for the clouds to part and a bolt of lightning to strike you in the brain, you are not going to do an awful lot of work. All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things occur to you. If you're sitting around trying to dream up a great idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction. Inspiration is absolutely unnecessary and somehow deceptive. You feel like you need this great idea before you can get down to work, and I find that's almost never the case.", "Design works best when it gets out of the user's way.", "If there is one word I'd like to remove from any conversation about design, it's ‚Äúpretty.‚Äù ", "People don't use a product because of the great design; great design helps them use the product.", "Design is about enabling ideas, processes and products: making them approachable, usable, desireable and memorable.", "If a design can be refined, without disturbing its image, it seems reasonable to do so.

The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can praise them, disagree with them, quote them, disbelieve them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.Maybe they have to be crazy.How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art?

Thoughtfulness is free and burns on time and empathy.", "When we have clients who are thinking about Flash splash pages, we tell them to go to their local supermarket and bring a mime with them. Have the mime stand in front of the supermarket, and, as each customer tries to enter, do a little show that lasts two minutes, welcoming them to the supermarket and trying to explain the bread is on aisle six and milk is on sale today. Then stand back and count how many people watch the mime, how many people get past the mime as quickly as possible, and how many people punch the mime out. That should give you a good idea as to how well their splash page will be received.", "A perfect implementation of the wrong specification is worthless. By the same principle a beautifully crafted library with no documentation is also damn near worthless. If your software solves the wrong problem or nobody can figure out how to use it, there's something very bad going on.", "Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are even incapable of forming such opinions.", "There is no such thing as information overload, just bad design. If something is cluttered and/or confusing, fix your design.", "Designers deal in ideas. They give shape to ideas that shape our world, enrich everyday experiences, and improve our lives. Where there's confusion, designers fashion clarity; where there's chaos, designers construct order; where there's entropy, designers promote vitality; where there's indifference, designers swell passion; where there's mediocrity, designers imbue excellence; and where there's silence, designers lend voice.", "Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.", "This is our job as designers - to continue making decisions until the purpose of the design is perfectly clear.
